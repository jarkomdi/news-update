The match was filled with intense rallies, incredible shot-making, and a display of mental and physical strength from both players. Let's take a look back at the highlights of this historic final. </p><h2>Introduction</h2><p> The pain points associated with the 2013 Wimbledon final for Andy Murray were immense.
