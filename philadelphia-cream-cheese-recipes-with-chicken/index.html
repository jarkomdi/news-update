The product was first created in 1872 by a New York dairyman named William Lawrence. He accidentally discovered the process of making cream cheese when he was attempting to recreate a French cheese known as NeufchÃ¢tel. Lawrence's cream cheese gained popularity and became known as "Philadelphia cream cheese" due to its high quality and smooth texture. Over the years, Philadelphia cream cheese has become a staple ingredient in many American households and is now widely used in a variety of recipes, including those with chicken. </p><p> There are also some myths and misconceptions surrounding Philadelphia cream cheese. One common myth is that it is not real cheese, but rather a processed food product. This couldn't be further from the truth. Philadelphia cream cheese is made from all-natural ingredients, including cream, milk, and salt. It undergoes a simple and traditional process of curdling and draining, resulting in a smooth and creamy texture.

First, always use softened cream cheese. This will make it easier to mix with other ingredients and will result in a smoother sauce or filling. You can soften cream cheese by leaving it at room temperature for about 30 minutes or by microwaving it on low power for a few seconds. Second, season your chicken well before cooking. This will help to enhance the flavor of the chicken and prevent it from tasting bland. Finally, don't overcook your chicken. Chicken breasts can become dry and tough if cooked for too long. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F, and then remove it from the heat immediately. </p><h4>The Fun Facts of Philadelphia Cream Cheese Recipes with Chicken</h4><p> Did you know that Philadelphia cream cheese is not actually from Philadelphia?
