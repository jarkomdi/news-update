It is a statement that laid the foundation for the United States of America and is considered one of the most important documents in the history of the world. </p><p> The Declaration of Independence definition encompasses more than just the act of declaring independence. It is a statement of the principles and ideals that the new nation would be based on.

It is often portrayed as a heroic and noble act, with the Founding Fathers bravely standing up to British tyranny.
