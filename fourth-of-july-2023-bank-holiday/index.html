Whether it's a picnic in the park, a day at the beach, or a backyard barbecue, there are endless possibilities for enjoying the Fourth of July. </p><p> The Fourth of July 2023 Bank Holiday, also known as Independence Day, is a federal holiday in the United States that commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. This historic document declared the thirteen American colonies to be independent from British rule, marking the birth of the United States of America. Today, the Fourth of July is celebrated with fireworks, parades, picnics, barbecues, and other festive activities across the country. </p><p> The history of the Fourth of July Bank Holiday dates back to the late 18th century, when the Continental Congress declared independence from Great Britain.

While the history of the holiday is well-known, there are also several myths and legends associated with the Fourth of July, such as the story of Betsy Ross and the creation of the first American flag. </p><p> While the Fourth of July is a day of celebration and enjoyment, there are also hidden secrets and traditions associated with the holiday. For example, did you know that the original draft of the Declaration of Independence was written on hemp paper? Or that the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia is tapped thirteen times on the Fourth of July to symbolize the thirteen original colonies? These little-known facts and traditions add an extra layer of significance to the holiday and make it even more special. </p><p> If you're looking for recommendations on how to make the most of the Fourth of July 2023 Bank Holiday, there are plenty of options to choose from.
