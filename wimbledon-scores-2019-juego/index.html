It was first held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, and has been held there ever since. Over the years, the tournament has grown in size and stature, attracting the best players from around the world. Wimbledon is known for its traditions, including the strict dress code, the eating of strawberries and cream, and the absence of advertising on the courts. </p><p> One of the most enduring myths about Wimbledon is the "Curse of the Middle Sunday." According to this myth, no play is allowed on the middle Sunday of the tournament, regardless of weather conditions.

Since then, the middle Sunday has been kept as a rest day, allowing the courts to recover and ensuring that the tournament stays on schedule. </p><p> Another myth associated with Wimbledon is the belief that the tournament's grass courts are slower than other surfaces. While it is true that grass courts can be more unpredictable and offer a different playing experience compared to hard courts or clay courts, it is not accurate to say that they are slower.
