Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money or the return on investment. They can be influenced by various factors such as inflation, economic conditions, and central bank policies.

This is an important consideration for investors who hold bonds in their portfolio. </p><p> When it comes to what were interest rates today, it's always a good idea to consult with a trusted financial advisor.
